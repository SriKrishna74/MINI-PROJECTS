# MOTION DETECT TELEGRAM ALART USING ESP32CAM

## ABSTRACT
This project presents the development of an intelligent motion detection system using the ESP32-CAM module. The system is designed to detect motion in a specific area and promptly send real-time notification messages, along with captured images, to the user's Telegram account. The integration of the ESP32 microcontroller, a camera module, and the Telegram API enables seamless communication and remote monitoring capabilities.

The initial phase involves setting up the hardware, where the ESP32-CAM is connected to a computer via a USB-to-serial converter, and powered either through an external power supply or USB cable. The Arduino IDE is utilized to program the ESP32-CAM, and the necessary libraries are installed to facilitate communication with the camera module and Telegram API.

A Telegram bot is created using the Telegram BotFather, and the unique API token is obtained for communication between the ESP32-CAM and Telegram servers. The ESP32-CAM is then connected to a local Wi-Fi network, granting it access to the internet for sending Telegram messages.

The motion detection algorithm is implemented to analyze consecutive frames captured by the camera module. Any significant pixel differences between frames are identified as motion, triggering the capture of an image of the detected intruder.

Upon detecting motion, the system encodes the captured image, preparing it for transmission via the Telegram API. Telegram messages containing the captured images are instantly sent to the user's Telegram account, providing them with visual evidence of the intrusion.

To minimize false positives, the system incorporates adjustable sensitivity settings and compares multiple frames before issuing a confirmation of motion.

Additionally, energy-saving measures, such as deep sleep mode, are considered to optimize power management, ensuring the system's long-term efficiency.

Throughout the project's development, privacy and security concerns are carefully addressed. The system respects individual privacy, and users are informed if they are under surveillance. Adherence to local laws and regulations regarding surveillance and privacy is a fundamental aspect of the project's design.

The project's successful implementation culminates in a cost-effective and reliable motion detection system, offering real-time Telegram notifications with visual evidence of intrusions. The system finds applications in home security, remote monitoring, and other scenarios where timely detection and notification are crucial.
